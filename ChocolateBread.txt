Ingredients
4-1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1/3 cup baking cocoa
2 tablespoons sugar
1 package (1/4 ounce) active dry yeast
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1 cup water
1/2 cup 2% milk
1/2 cup semisweet chocolate chips
2 tablespoons butter
1 large egg, room temperature
Optional: Baking cocoa and/or confectioners' sugar
Directions
In a bowl, combine 1-1/4 cups flour, cocoa, sugar, yeast, salt and baking soda. In a saucepan, heat the water, milk, chocolate chips and butter; stir until chocolate is melted. Cool to 120°-130°. Add to dry ingredients; beat on medium speed for 2 minutes. Add 1/2 cup flour and egg; beat on high for 2 minutes. Stir in enough remaining flour to form a stiff dough.
Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, 6-8 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour.
Punch dough down. Turn onto a lightly floured surface; divide in half. Shape into loaves. Place in 2 greased 8x4-in. loaf pans. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 1 hour.
Bake at 375° until browned, 25-30 minutes. Remove from pans to cool on wire racks. Dust with baking cocoa and/or confectioners' sugar if desired.
