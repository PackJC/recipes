Ingredients:
1 cup basmati rice (rinsed well)
1 ¾ cups water (or chicken/vegetable broth for extra flavor)
1 tbsp olive oil or butter
1 tsp turmeric powder (for the yellow color)
½ tsp ground cumin
¼ tsp garlic powder
¼ tsp onion powder
Salt to taste
Optional: a pinch of ground coriander or cinnamon (for additional warmth)
Instructions:
Rinse the rice thoroughly in cold water until the water runs clear. This removes excess starch and keeps the rice fluffy.
Heat olive oil or butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat.
Add turmeric, cumin, garlic powder, and onion powder to the pan, stirring for 30 seconds until fragrant.
Add the rinsed rice and stir to coat it in the spice mixture. Toast for 1-2 minutes.
Add water or broth and salt, then bring to a boil.
Once boiling, reduce the heat to low, cover, and let simmer for about 15 minutes (or until the liquid is absorbed and rice is tender).
Turn off the heat and let the rice sit, covered, for another 5 minutes.
Fluff with a fork and serve.
