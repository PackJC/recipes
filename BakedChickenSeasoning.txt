2 teaspoons paprika
▢1 teaspoon dried oregano, or Italian seasoning
▢½ teaspoon garlic powder
▢½ teaspoon salt
▢¼ teaspoon pepper
Other Ingredients:
▢4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts
▢1 tablespoon olive oil
Instructions
 
Preheat oven to 425° F.
Combine the seasoning ingredients in a small bowl: paprika, dried oregano, garlic powder, salt and pepper. Stir or whisk to mix. Set aside.
Place the chicken breasts in a large zip-top bag or between two sheets of parchment paper or plastic wrap and pound them to an even thickness using a meat mallet or rolling pin.
Place chicken breasts in a baking dish. Pat chicken dry with paper towels. Drizzle with the olive oil and rub over both sides of chicken.
Rub the seasoning rub over both sides of the chicken.
Bake chicken breasts according to their size: bake 5-6 ounce breasts for 13-16 minutes, bake 8 ounce breasts for 16-19 minutes, bake 11-12 ounce breasts for 22-26 minutes. Check that chicken has reached an internal temperature of 165° F by inserting an instant read thermometer into the thickest part of the meat.
Remove the pan from the oven and let the chicken rest for 5 minutes before slicing and serving. When slicing chicken, slice it against the grain for the most tender result.
