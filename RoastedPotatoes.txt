Ingredients:
1.5 pounds red potatoes (about 6-8 medium potatoes), cut into 1-inch pieces
2-3 tbsp olive oil
1 tsp salt
½ tsp black pepper
1 tsp garlic powder
1 tsp dried rosemary (or fresh, finely chopped)
1 tsp dried thyme (or fresh, finely chopped)
Optional: ½ tsp paprika (for added color and flavor)
Instructions:
Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C).
Prepare the potatoes by rinsing them well and cutting them into even 1-inch pieces. This ensures even cooking.
In a large bowl, toss the potatoes with olive oil, salt, pepper, garlic powder, rosemary, thyme, and paprika if you’re using it. Make sure the potatoes are evenly coated.
Spread the potatoes in a single layer on a baking sheet. For extra crispiness, make sure they’re not crowded.
Roast in the oven for about 30-35 minutes, flipping halfway through, until they’re golden brown and crispy on the outside and tender on the inside.
Remove from the oven and let them cool slightly. Add more salt or herbs if desired.
