Ingredients:
2 tsp ground coriander
1.5 tsp cumin powder
1 tsp paprika (or smoked paprika for extra depth)
1 tsp garlic powder
1 tsp onion powder
1 tsp ground black pepper
1 tsp salt (adjust to taste)
½ tsp turmeric
½ tsp cayenne pepper (optional for a bit of heat)
½ tsp cinnamon (adds warmth)
Instructions:
Mix all spices together in a bowl until well blended.
Apply to steak as a dry rub or combine with olive oil to create a marinade.
Marinate for at least 30 minutes to 1 hour for the flavors to develop. If using a dry rub, you can also let it sit overnight for deeper flavor.
