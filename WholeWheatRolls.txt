Ingredients
2 tablespoons active dry yeast* instant works, too
1/2 cup warm water
1/2 cup butter softened
1/4 cup honey
3 eggs
1 cup lukewarm buttermilk or milk
4½ to 5 cups whole wheat flour
1 ½ teaspoons salt
Instructions
Dissolve the yeast in the 1/2 cup warm water in a glass measure. Set aside.
Cream the butter and honey in the bowl of a stand mixer with the paddle attachment.
Add the eggs and mix, scraping the sides. Add the warmed milk along with the yeast mixture.
Add 4½ cups of flour and the salt, mixing until combined.
Change to dough hook and knead for 2-3 minutes only, just until no longer tacky, adding a tablespoon or two of flour at a time, if needed. (Do not add too much.)
Let sit in bowl, covered, to rise for one hour. Turn out onto a floured surface and knead a couple of times, then let rest 3 minutes.
Divide into 24 equal pieces, shaping each into a ball and placing in a buttered 13x9-inch baking dish with the pieces touching.
Let rise, covered for 1 hour.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Bake for 20-25 minutes until golden brown.
